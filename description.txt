1) ask for user intput of tasks - most/second/third and nontrivial.
	most/second/third should be one task each, nontrivial can be several.
2) save tasks into a toDoList (and file?).
3) throughout day send text with top 7 elements of toDoList.
4) throughout day create pop up on screen reminding user of his/her tasks on toDoList. 


5) at end of day create pop up to prompt user to to 1) again and create a new toDolist ( 2) ).
6) repeat steps 3-5. 

-------------------------------------------------------

classes:

- tasks -> toDoItem (most,second,third,nontrivial)
- toDoList
- pop ups => screen reminders, asking for user input ?
- text message ?
